# Common metadata
**Harmonising ship data through the use of common metadata** 

This repository aims to identify the common metadata and standards required to harmonise data formats across the UK large research vessels. Our aim is to ensure all files are self-describing, no matter the format used while making them easily interpretable by users of all abilities. Common metadata have been extracted from several conventions including [CF Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/latest.html), [ACDD](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3#Context) and [SeaDataNet Transportation Formats](https://www.doi.org/10.13155/56547). Not all metadata are applicable to all I/Ocean file types. 

Below, common metadata have been grouped according to:


|Group | Description
--- | --- 
| [Global properties](globalProperties.md) | Properties common to the whole file |
| [Coordinate variables](coordinateVariables.md) | properties that are common to variables that align observations such as time, geographical position and depth. |
