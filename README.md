**Harmonising ship data through the use of common metadata** 

This repository aims to identify the common metadata and standards required to harmonise data formats across the UK large research vessels. Our aim is to ensure all files are self-describing, no matter the format used while making them easily interpretable by users of all abilities. Common metadata have been grouped according to:
<br />
<br />
|Group | Description
--- | --- 
| [Global properties](https://github.com/I-Ocean/common-metadata/edit/master/README.md) | Properties common to the whole file |
| [Coordinate variables](https://github.com/I-Ocean/common-metadata/edit/master/README.md) | Properties common to variables such as time and geographical position |
| [Observed measurements](https://github.com/I-Ocean/common-metadata/edit/master/README.md) | Properties common to environmental observations measured by sensor arrays |
| [Instruments](https://github.com/I-Ocean/common-metadata/edit/master/README.md) | Properties that accurately identify the instruments that are used to measure environmental observations and help to interpret their variables, putting data into context |
